# Learning and Estimation of Dynamical System Project

The project is developed as partial fulfillment of "Learning and Identification of Dynamical Systems" course held by professor Diversi at University of Bologna.
This project goal is to apply and verify the theory of discrete time systems identification and some basic stuff about 
supervised learning.  
In the *project_Feb16_2022.mlx* file there is the project assignment, and in the file *Cecconi_Alessandro.mlx* there is the project solution.

The project solution makes use of the functions in the folder *Function* and contains also explanations about the theory used.

**NB** Since the project data are based on content-obscured executable files, **DO NOT** run the main *.mlx* otherwise you'll lose all the solutions.
